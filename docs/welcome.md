## How It Works

Mendo.org is basically a big shared mailbox for everyone to read, and to send e-mails to.  In addition to manually posted content, the system is also subscribed to the [MCN Announce ListServ](http://www.mcn.org/email/listserv.html), so it "ingests" all those e-mails as well, making them available for you to read online.

Each incoming e-mail becomes a new "topic" if it has a unique subject line that has not been used recently.  Then, if more e-mails come in with the same (or very similar) subject, they are considered to be "replies" to that topic, and they are displayed in a simple threaded fashion.  Topics are categorized automatically by our staff (and coming soon, AI).

You can view content on the site in the following ways:

- **Recent Topics** &mdash; This displays the latest topic threads, with the newest on top.  You can also navigate back through history and look at older topics.
- **Hot Topics** &mdash; This displays the hottest topics threads (this really just means the topics with the most replies), sorted by hottest on top.
- **Calendar** &mdash; This shows you upcoming special events in the area, such as concerts, shows, and festivals.
- **Search** &mdash; Here you can compose your own custom search queries, and even save them for quick use in the sidebar.
- **Favorites** &mdash; These are saved messages that you liked, or just want to remember or read later.
- **Categories** &mdash; All topics are sorted into categories which are displayed on the sidebar.  Click to see the latest topics in each category.
- **Locations** &mdash; All topics are also sorted into locations (local city / town names), which are also available in the sidebar.

In all cases, you can click on the subject line of any topic to see details, including all the replies.  Icons are provided on the top-right corner of each topic that allows you to reply, mark it as a "favorite", or block the sender.

## FAQ

Here are some questions you may have, and some answers from us!

### Do I need to be on the ListServ to use Mendo.org?

Nope, you do not, but it is recommended.  The reason is, if you are a registered user of the [MCN Announce ListServ](http://www.mcn.org/email/listserv.html), then when you post your own topics or replies on Mendo.org they can be cross-posted back to the ListServ (and thus reaching far more people).

### Are you affiliated with MCN?

We are not affiliated with the [Mendocino Community Network](http://mcn.org/), but we are a happy customer of theirs.  We are simply an independent local subscriber of the [MCN Announce ListServ](http://www.mcn.org/email/listserv.html), and we automatically import all ListServ messages into Mendo.org for your online viewing pleasure.

### So I can post anything I want?

Well, within reason.  It should be said that we reserve the right to delete any message we deem inappropriate (examples include fake news, hate speech, adult content, etc.), or we may move messages into an "Off-Topic" category, which is hidden for all users by default.  For repeated offenses we may ban accounts and/or block sender addresses.  See our [terms of service](/terms) for more details.

Another important note: If you are going to cross-post your messages onto the ListServ (we provide a checkbox to do this on a post-by-post basis), please observe [their rules and conditions](http://www.mcn.org/email/atos.html).

### Is my data safe?

Yes, absolutely.  If you mean your personal identifiable information in your account, we use industry standard encryption and salted password hashing to protect your account.  Our servers are secure, and use modern patched Linux kernels, which will be kept up to date.  Our website also uses HTTPS (SSL) encryption for all requests.

Your posted messages are also safe, but keep in mind that posting to the ListServ (and/or Mendo.org) means that the information in your e-mail is effectively publicly available.  This is because anyone can sign up for the ListServ and Mendo.org for free, no matter who they are or where they live.  We do not restrict membership (nor does MCN).

### What about search engines?

Web search engines like Google, Bing, and Duck Duck Go will **not** index anything on this website.  This is because we disallow it at the root level by including a special [robots exclusion standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard) file which they all honor.  Also, the entire site's contents are inaccessible unless you actually sign up for an account and log in, which search engines will not do.

### Are you putting my e-mail in the cloud?

Well, first, it's important to understand that any e-mail you send is inherently public, and likely already stored in some cloud somewhere.  E-mail is [not a secure form of communication](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/can-email-ever-be-secure/) (except in rare circumstances when both parties use special e-mail encryption software).  E-mail technology was not designed with any privacy or security in mind, so if you send a message, especially to a list server, it's effectively public.

But to answer your question, your e-mails sent to the ListServ or messages posted on Mendo.org are all stored on our server, and that server is, technically speaking, in a "cloud".  But we aren't making your messages any *more* public than they already are.  They are exposed to the same trolls and hackers that can also subscribe to the ListServ.

### Will you block trolls and hackers?

We will do our best to prevent hackers from compromising the site, and our administrators will delete all spam messages that make it through.  Trolls are a more complicated topic, however.  You should read our [terms of service](/terms) for details, but in short, we will delete any message we deem inappropriate (examples include fake news, hate speech, adult content, etc.), or more often we will move messages into an "Off-Topic" category, which is hidden for all users by default.  For repeated offenses we may ban accounts and/or block sender addresses.

Also, you can block any senders that you want when using Mendo.org.  Every message has a convenient <i class="mdi mdi-cancel"></i> **Block Sender** icon in the top-right corner, which you can click and never see another e-mail from them ever again.  You can also hide entire categories if they don't suit your fancy.  Your settings are saved with your account (you can manage your blocked senders list and category filters on the Preferences page).

### How are messages categorized?

Currently, we have a number of volunteers who sort messages into various categories.  The goal, however, is to eventually switch over to a [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) model, which can automatically categorize most incoming e-mails for us.  The system is currently being "trained" on the data set as it grows.

### How long do you keep old e-mails on the site?

The plan is to keep the latest five years worth of e-mail going forward, but we'll see how our database holds up.

### How do you make money?

Mendo.org is a donation to the community, and is not for profit.  The software is also [open source](https://github.com/jhuckaby/mendo.org).

### How much does it cost to run this site?

It costs about $35 per month to run the service.

### Who made this thing?

I did.  I'm [Joseph Huckaby](https://twitter.com/jhuckaby), and I live in the village of Mendocino.

### I need some help!

Sure, please e-mail us at support@mendo.org, and we will reply as soon as we can!
