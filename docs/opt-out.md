## How to Opt Out

If you do not agree with the Mendo.org [terms of service](/terms) or [privacy policy](/privacy), you can always delete your account.  This can be done by going to the [My Account](#MyAccount) screen, and clicking the "Delete Account..." button.

However, if you want to prevent Mendo.org from processing **any** of your e-mails sent to the ListServ, you can go through a process called "opting out".  To do this you must first verify that you own your e-mail address (so we know you are who you say you are), and then you can select an option where we will ignore (i.e. skip) all e-mails sent by you to the ListServ.  Effectively, this will remove all your content from the site going forward.

Please **do not delete your account** in this case.  We need an account on file to associate with your verified e-mail address, and your preference that you do not want us to process any ListServ mail sent from you.

Please note that we cannot always guarantee that your content will never show up on the site.  For example, another user may reply to one of your e-mails and *include your original message as quoted text* in their e-mail body.  In this case, your e-mail will technically still appear on Mendo.org, because it wasn't sent from your address -- it was included inside the body of another user's e-mail.  This is one example where there is really nothing we can do to prevent your content from appearing on the site.

If you still want to opt out, here are the steps:

### Step 1: Create an Account

You must have an account with us in order to opt out.  This is because we need to verify your e-mail address, and keep your opt-out preference on file, and this must be associated with an account in our system.  [Click here](/signup) to create a free account, if you haven't already done so.

### Step 2: Verify your E-mail Address

We need to verify that you own your e-mail address before we can take any action.  This is to ensure that you are who you say you are, and not attempting to block another user from posting to the site.  When you first create your account, Mendo.org sends you a welcome e-mail, which contains a special link.  Click this link to verify your address.

If you did not receive the e-mail, it may have been flagged as spam.  You can resend the verification e-mail at any time by going to the [My Account](#MyAccount) screen, and clicking on the "**What's this?**" link next to the red **Unverified** badge.

### Step 3: Opt-Out and Save Changes

Once you have verified your e-mail address, return to the [My Account](#MyAccount) screen, and make sure there is a green **Verified** badge and checkmark displayed on the right side of your e-mail.

Finally, click the checkbox labeled "**Opt-Out From ListServ Ingest**".  A dialog box will appear asking you to confirm your selection.  Once you confirm, make sure you click the **Save Changes** button to commit the changes to your user account.

At this point you have successfully opted out, and no future mail will be processed from you, when sent to the ListServ from your verified address.  Note that you can still post topics and replies directly on the Mendo.org website, if you so desire.

If you ever change your mind, you can simply log back in, return to the [My Account](#MyAccount) screen, uncheck the opt-out checkbox, and save your changes.

### Optional: Delete All Historical Mail

If you want, we can also delete all your historical mail from the site.  This must be done by sending us an e-mail at support@mendo.org (please send this from your verified e-mail address).  We will respond to your request within 24 hours, excluding weekends and holidays.
