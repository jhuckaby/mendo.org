## User's Guide

### Overview

This guide is designed to help you navigate through the Mendo.org application.  Mendo.org is a free community forum website, which is open to all members of the Mendocino community, and surrounding cities.  Here you can post topics for discussion, reply to others, view a calendar of events, and more.  Membership is and always will be completely free.

### Signing Up

In order to post and read content on Mendo.org, you will have to create an account.  This is very easy, and simply involves choosing a unique username, entering your name and e-mail address, and providing a password to protect your account.  You can find the **[new user sign-up form right here](/signup)**.

Please note that if you are a registered user of the **[MCN Announce ListServ](http://www.mcn.org/email/listserv.html)**, then it is highly recommended you use the same e-mail address to sign up with Mendo.org.  The reason is, Mendo.org allows you to cross-post your content back to the ListServ (thereby reaching far more people), but this feature only works if you send from a registered ListServ e-mail address.

If you aren't a registered ListServ user then don't worry, you can still read everything and post topics and replies to Mendo.org.  However, your posts will only live here on the site -- they won't be sent back to the ListServ as e-mails.

Once you complete the signup form, you can **[login](/login)** and start using Mendo.org.  However, please note that before you can actually post your own topics and replies, you must **verify your e-mail address**.  You should have received a welcome e-mail from Mendo.org, which contains a verification link.  Please click that link to verity your address.  We do this to make sure you actually own the e-mail address you will be posting from.

If you didn't receive your welcome e-mail, then it may be caught in your spam filter.  To send it again, please go to the **[<i class="mdi mdi-account"></i> My Account](#MyAccount)** screen, and click on the "**What's this?**" link next to your e-mail address and the red "**Unverified**" label.  From there you can have Mendo.org re-send you the e-mail verification.  Also, it may help to add `admin@mendo.org` to your e-mail address book.

### Topics and Replies

All posts on Mendo.org are either topics or replies.  A topic is just a new thread, with a unique subject line.  Some topics stand alone, while others may have lots of replies.  The replies are automatically "attached" to their matching topics, so you can view each conversation thread separately.

Topics are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, with the newest postings at the top of the page.  But once you click into a topic (i.e. clicking on its subject line) the replies are sorted with the latest reply on the bottom.

All posts have a <i class="mdi mdi-reply-all"></i> (Reply) button located in the top-right corner.  Click this to send your own reply to the topic.

### Recent and Hot Topics

When you first login to Mendo.org, you will be placed onto the **[<i class="mdi mdi-calendar-clock"></i> Recent Topics](#RecentNew)** page.  This shows you the most recent topics posted for the current month, sorted by date, with the very latest on top.  You can click the subject line of any topic to read its replies, or click the <i class="mdi mdi-reply-all"></i> (Reply) button to add your own.

On the left-hand sidebar, notice that the "Recent Topics" item is highlighted in blue.  This indicates which page you are currently on.  If you look just under it, you'll see an item named **[<i class="mdi mdi-fire"></i> Hot Topics](#RecentHot)**.  This page also shows recent topics for the month, but in this case they are sorted by the number of replies.  The topics with the most replies are displayed first.

At the very top of both pages, you will find links to navigate to past months, and also collapse / expand the topics.  When viewing in compact mode, only the subject, date and sender are visible.  The body text is hidden (unless you click the subject).  In this way you can scan many topics quickly.

### Categories

All topics on Mendo.org are sorted into categories (either automatically or by hand).  These categories are all listed on the left-hand sidebar, and you can click each one to see all the recent topics for that category (newest on top).  Note that a topic may be tagged in *multiple* categories, for example **[<i class="mdi mdi-food"></i> Food](#Tag?id=food)** and **[<i class="mdi mdi-glass-cocktail"></i> Entertainment](#Tag?id=entertainment)**.

There are two "special" categories to mention.  The first is **[<i class="mdi mdi-filter-outline"></i> Unsorted](#Tag?id=unsorted)**, which holds all topics that have not yet been sorted.  Once they are assigned a category, they are removed from Unsorted.  The second is **[<i class="mdi mdi-content-cut"></i> Off-Topic](#Tag?id=offtopic)**, which holds all posts deemed irrelevant to the community.  Examples include hate speech, adult content, etc.

Off-Topic is filtered by default for all new users, meaning all posts are hidden from view.  If you want to see them, you can either click directly on the Off-Topic link in the sidebar, or remove the filter on the **[<i class="mdi mdi-cog"></i> Preferences](#MySettings)** page.

### Locations

In addition to categories, topics may also be tagged by location.  These are city names in Mendocino County, and they are applied automatically to new topics as they are posted.  To find topics by location, go back to the left-hand sidebar, and scroll it down.  The sidebar scrolls independently of the main view.  Once you scroll below the list of categories, you'll see a heading named **<i class="mdi mdi-map-marker-multiple"></i> Locations**.  Click on this to expand the section, and then pick the city name you are interested in.

The location view works similarly to the category view.  All matching topics are displayed, sorted by date, with the newest on top.  The app will show up to 50 topics at a time, and provide a link at the very bottom to load more, if applicable.

### Calendar of Events

Want to see what's happening this weekend?  Check out the **[<i class="mdi mdi-calendar-multiple"></i> Calendar](#Calendar)**, which is available in the sidebar just under the Recent and Hot Topics items.  The Calendar shows all events that have an attached date or dates, including dances, concerts, festivals, theater, art shows, craft fairs, etc.  Calendar items are really just topics that were posted with included dates.

The Calendar shows topics in date order for the current month.  That is, instead of the date which the topics were posted, they are sorted by the dates of the events themselves.  Events that span multiple dates will show on multiple days.

Topics are always shown in "compact" mode here, meaning the body text is hidden, and only the subject, sender, dates and categories are displayed.  For more information about an event, simply click on the subject line, and it will expand showing all of the content, as well as any replies.

To navigate between different calendar months, click the **&laquo; Prev Month** and **Next Month &raquo;** links in the top-right corner.

### Favorites

If you come across a topic or a reply that you like, or just want to save it for later, click on the <i class="mdi mdi-heart-outline"></i> (Heart) icon located at the top-right corner of the message box.  This will add the post as a "favorite", and it will be saved in your account.  The heart icon turns red (<i class="mdi mdi-heart favorite"></i>) to indicate that it has been flagged.  If you change your mind, simply click the heart icon again, and the post will be un-favorited.

To view your favorites at any time, click on the **[<i class="icon mdi mdi-heart-multiple"></i> Favorites](#Favorites)** link in the left-hand sidebar.  They are sorted by date, with the newest on top.

### Performing Searches

To perform a search, you can use the "Quick Search" box location on the top-right corner of every page.  Enter your search query (one or more words) and press Enter.  This searches all the posts on the site (both topics and replies), and shows all results that matched the words you entered.  By default the subject, sender (address) and message body are all searched.  To match an exact phrase, surround it with "double quotes".

For a more advanced search with more options, click on the **[<i class="icon mdi mdi-cloud-search-outline"></i> Search](#Search)** link in the left-hand sidebar.  This form allows you to perform a more exact search, and offers more options.  You can limit your search to particular categories and/or locations, only show messages posted within a date range, and change the sorting order.

There are many other features available in the search system, including saving personal presets and search alerts.  For details, see our **[<i class="icon mdi mdi-file-document-outline"></i> Search Guide](#Document?id=search)**.

### Posting Content

Ready to start posting your own content?  It couldn't be easier.  Just head on over to the **[<i class="icon mdi mdi-file-document-edit-outline"></i> Post New Topic](#NewTopic)** link in the left-hand sidebar.  You'll need to provide a subject line, and some body text, just like composing an e-mail.

You can also post replies to other topics.  This is done by clicking the <i class="mdi mdi-reply-all"></i> (Reply) button located in the top-right corner of every post.  A reply requires only body text (the same subject is used).

Note that you can add styling to your posts (i.e. rich text), but this only shows up when viewed on Mendo.org.  For details on this, see our **[<i class="icon mdi mdi-file-document-outline"></i> Formatting Guide](#Document?id=markdown)**.

Attachments are allowed on Mendo.org.  Since attachments are not allowed on the ListServ, this is a bit tricky.  The way it works is, your files are uploaded to our server and unique URLs are generated to each.  Those URLs are then inserted into your post body text, one per line.  If the files are images, they will be expanded and viewable inline on Mendo.org, just like inline attachments.  Otherwise, users will just see the URLs which they can click on.  The URLs are also visible to users the ListServ.

All attachment file types are allowed, and files may be up to 10 MB in size.  Click the **<i class="mdi mdi-link-variant-plus"></i> Attach Files** button to upload, or just drag & drop your files onto the edit box.

When posting, you will see a "*Also send post to the Announce ListServ*" checkbox at the bottom of the page.  If this is checked, your post will be sent to the ListServ as well as posted on Mendo.org.  Please note that this feature only works if you have registered with an e-mail address that is **also** registered with the ListServ.

If you decide to cross-post to the ListServ, please observe [their rules and conditions](http://www.mcn.org/email/atos.html).

### Blocking Content

See something you don't like?  Simply click the <i class="mdi mdi-cancel"></i> (Block) icon located in the top-right corner of any topic of reply, and you can decide between blocking the individual sender, or filtering out entire categories.  Checkboxes are provided for both options.

When you block an individual user, their e-mail address is added to a filter list stored in your account.  All e-mails from that sender are hidden from your view, on all pages and in search results as well.  You can also filter out entire categories if you want.

When you filter a category, all topics tagged with that category are hidden from your view.  This includes the Recent Topics, Hot Topics, and all search results.  The categories themselves are still listed in the sidebar, but they are grayed out, and will be empty if you click on them.

You can manage your blocked senders and filtered categories on the **[<i class="mdi mdi-cog"></i> Preferences](#MySettings)** page.  Click the (x) icons to remove items from the filtered lists, or click anywhere else in the field to add more entries.  You can block as many users and categories as you want.

The Preferences page also allows you to enable or disable all your filters with one checkbox.

### Downloading

Mendo.org allows you to download any set of search results, topic threads, or your favorites list as a [Mbox mail archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) file.  This is a special file format that can be imported into many popular e-mail applications, including Apple Mail and Mozilla Thunderbird.  Basically, this allows you to download a local copy of any messages you want.

Simply click the **<i class="mdi mdi-cloud-download-outline"></i> Download All** button to download all the messages in the current view as an Mbox file.  Download buttons are provided on search results, message threads (when you click on a topic subject line), and the Favorites page.  You will be prompted to enter a desired filename for the Mbox file, which should then arrive in your "Downloads" folder (or wherever your browser downloads files to).

### Changing Preferences

Click the **[<i class="mdi mdi-cog"></i> Preferences](#MySettings)** link in the sidebar (towards the bottom), to edit your preferences for Mendo.org.  These settings are set for your account, and automatically saved.  Here are the settings you can customize:

| Setting | Description |
|-|-|
| **Date/Time&nbsp;Format** | Choose your desired date/time format. Times are always adjusted to your local timezone. |
| **Display&nbsp;Format** | Choose your desired text format for reading posts. Note that only Rich Text (Markdown) mode supports inline images. |
| **Display&nbsp;Font** | Choose your desired display font for reading and composing posts. |
| **Font&nbsp;Size** | Choose your desired font size for reading and composing posts. |
| **Show&nbsp;Inline&nbsp;Images** | When checked, image URLs found in e-mails will be expanded, and the images displayed inline. This is only applicable in Rich Text mode. If you are on limited bandwidth you might want to disable this feature. |
| **Censor&nbsp;Bad&nbsp;Words** | Are you offended by seeing bad words? If so, simply check this box, and we will do our best to censor all profanity from all messages across the site (English language only). |
| **Enable&nbsp;Filters&nbsp;&&nbsp;Blocks** | This checkbox controls whether the category filters and blocked senders are enabled or not (see below). Uncheck this box if you want to temporarily see all the bad content that you're missing. |
| **Filter&nbsp;Categories** | Optionally select categories to filter out (i.e. hide) from your view. |
| **Block&nbsp;Senders** | Optionally add specific senders (names or e-mail addresses) to block from your view. |
| **Email&nbsp;Signature** | Optionally enter a personalized signature to append to the bottom of all your posts and replies. |

### Account Security

Mendo.org keeps track of all changes to your user account, especially important changes like your e-mail address and password.  All these actions are tracked, including things like user logins, and a security log is made available to you for safety purposes.  Click the **[<i class="mdi mdi-shield-account"></i> Security Log](#MySecurity)** link in the sidebar to see all user actions related to your account.

Each action is tagged with the source IP address and User Agent string.  Using these pieces of information, you can make sure that **you** were the one making the changes.  If you suspect that someone else has control of your account, you can click the **Logout All Sessions** button at the bottom of the Security Log.  If anyone is using your account without authorization, such as a browser window left open somewhere, this will log everything out.

To change your password, go to the **[<i class="mdi mdi-account"></i> My Account](#MyAccount)** screen.  Enter your current passsword and a new one (make it strong!) and click the **Save Changes** button.

It is highly recommended that you create a strong password to protect your account, and if you use any public computers, make sure you use a [private browsing window](https://www.howtogeek.com/269265/how-to-enable-private-browsing-on-any-web-browser/).

### Logging Out

To logout and close your Mendo.org session, click the <i class="mdi mdi-logout"></i> (Logout) icon located in the very top-right corner of every page.  Make sure you do this if you are using a public computer, as it protects your account.

### Account Deletion

Don't want to use Mendo.org anymore?  No problem, go to the **[<i class="mdi mdi-account"></i> My Account](#MyAccount)** screen, and you will find a **Delete Account** button at the bottom of the page.
